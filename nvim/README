Initially started by following the Primeagen tutorial here: https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE

Found it to be pretty outdated. For instance, switched to lazy.nvim shortly after starting once I realized Packer is nearing EOL.

So the foundations are in that tutorial, but I quickly veered off and have since stopped following the tutorial.
